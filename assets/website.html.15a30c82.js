You know Markdown), then save and commit. It&#39;s that easy. If you want to see your changes on your fork, you&#39;ll have to either 1) rename the repo to <code>&lt;yourusersname&gt;.github.io</code> and set the Pages settings to build from the root of gh-pages, or 2) (if you have node installed), run <code>npm install &amp;&amp; npm run build &amp;&amp; npm run start</code>.</p><h2 id="what-to-do-and-not-to-do" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-to-do-and-not-to-do" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What to do and not to do</h2><p>You&#39;re allowed to pretty much change anything, as long as it follows all of these rules:</p><ul><li>Do not make any promises unless you were given permission from the developers.</li><li>Do not spread misinformation and inaccurate content.</li><li>Although you can change everything else, do not touch .vuepress/config.js.
