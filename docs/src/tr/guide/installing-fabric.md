# Fabric
* Fabric is a lightweight, experimental modding toolchain for Minecraft that PojavLauncher supports.
* Yes, PojavLauncher supports it but not every mod that is working with Fabric. See a list of mods [here](https://github.com/CriticalRange/PojavLauncher/wiki/Supported-Mods-List)
## Downloading Fabric

* After that click [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files) to install the Fabric API which will be needed by most of the mods to interact with Fabric modloader.

* Slide down until you see **Recent Files**, then select the Fabric API that is in your Minecraft version.

::: tip
On Android, you need to request "desktop site" or tilt your device horizontally in order to see the **download** button
